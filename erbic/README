TODO
  Program to the interfaces:
  Channel should be parametrised

  - Refactor SockMsgService2 typeclass to have fewer methods

  Show me your monads...
  - Convert code to reader monad to see if it makes sense
    - Try interaction with state???
      -> no, multithreading (locking) gets difficult,
         unless we only read values? =>
  - Abstract on channel operations (aka logger interface)
    -> should this be yet another app state (reader) instance?
       - I don't think so => they do not compose easily
